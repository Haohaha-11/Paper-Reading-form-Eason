Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced cross-modal understanding and reasoning by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the semantic space. Building upon this, recent studies extend the CoT mechanism to the visual modality, enabling models to integrate visual information during reasoning through external tools or explicit image generation. However, these methods remain dependent on explicit step-by-step reasoning, unstable perception–reasoning interaction and notable computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition, we posit that thinking unfolds not linearly but through the dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception within the mind. Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual–textual interleaving. Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures demonstrate that DMLR significantly improves reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency.

# 1. Introduction

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [1, 2, 3, 4] have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in integrating visual and linguistic information. This progress has facilitated the incorporation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into multimodal tasks, enabling models to construct structured reasoning paths across visual and textual modalities. Current multimodal reasoning approaches can be broadly categorized into three types: (1) Textual-only Reasoning [5, 6, 7], which generates intermediate reasoning steps in the sematic space. Such methods explicitly express reasoning logic through language generation but often suffer from language bias and insufficient visual grounding, as shown in Figure. 1(a). (2) Think with Images attempts to directly manipulate or augment images during reasoning, such as local zooming [8, 9], region highlighting [10, 11], or generating intermediate reasoning steps via diffusion models [12, 13] to enhance visual alignment. Despite their effectiveness in improving reasoning to a certain extent, they still face challenges such as unstable tool invocation and high inference overhead, as reflected in Figure 1(b). Recently, latent-space reasoning has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models, as exemplified by approaches such as CoCoNut [14] and LatentSeek [15]. Its core idea is to perform implicit reasoning in the latent space, replacing explicit textual steps with latent vectors to reduce redundant generation and capture more compact information. However, recent studies [16, 17, 18, 19] still rely on extra training to enforce latent reasoning triggered at fixed positions (via special tokens). This rigidity prevents the model from adaptively allocating reasoning effort.

Inspired by human cognition, we argue that reasoning is not fixed. Instead, humans dynamically revisit visual information, specifically when they encounter uncertainty. Drawing on this intuition, we empirically analyze the interplay between the model’s visual reliance and its internal confidence. Our analysis reveals two key phenomena: (i) Visual information is used only at a few specific stages of the reasoning process rather than at fixed positions, and (ii) Internal confidence serves as a natural indicator for the need of visual grounding as it strongly correlates with reasoning correctness. These findings suggest that effective multimodal reasoning relies on dynamic visual usage guided by internal confidence.

In light of these observations, we propose DMLR, a Test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning Framework, as shown in Figure 1(c). Specifically, it introduces optimizable latent think tokens to serve as a mental draft, which are iteratively refined through confidence-guided policy gradient updates. Crucially, we design a confidence-driven dynamic visual injection strategy. At each step, the model autonomously determines whether to revisit visual information and which contents to select (ranging from none to a few specific patches). This mechanism allows the model to naturally skip visual injection when internal confidence is sufficient, or actively integrate targeted visual clues when necessary, all driven by the objective of maximizing reasoning confidence, effectively mimicking the human cognitive process of checking visual clues to build confidence. After several iterations, the optimized latent tokens are decoded with the input without extra inference cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DMLR consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse architectures and tasks while maintaining high efficiency. The main contributions can be summarized as follows:

# 2. Related Work

Explicit Reasoning. Many prior works have explored visual reasoning. Early approaches mainly relied on semantic CoT, where the model performs all inference in the text space after a one-time visual encoding [5, 4, 20, 21]. However, this separation between perception and reasoning often leads to misalignment and hallucination [6, 22, 23, 24, 22, 25]. To address these limitations, recent studies adopt a Thinking-with-Images paradigm, where the model can draw auxiliary elements [13, 26, 27], zoom or crop regions [11, 8, 28, 29], or generate intermediate visual cues [30, 10, 9], enabling it to reason directly over visual structures.

Latent Reasoning. Recently, an increasing number of studies have begun to shift reasoning from the explicit token space to the model’s latent representation space. Some methods introduce dedicated training frameworks that optimize latent representations to support more effective internal reasoning [31, 14, 32, 33, 34, 35], while others propose training-free approaches that manipulate latent activations during inference to refine the reasoning process [15, 36, 37, 38, 39]. In addition, several recent works explore injecting visual information into the latent space [16, 17, 40, 41, 18], enabling models to iteratively operate over both latent semantic features and latent visual cues, thereby supporting a more flexible form of interleaved multimodal reasoning.

# 3. Preliminary and Motivation

As shown in Figure 12, existing reasoning paradigms commonly suffer from insufficient visual grounding, unstable tool invocation, and high computational overhead. These limitations motivate a fundamental question: why can’t MLLMs reason like humans do, dynamically deciding how to reason and which visual information to pay attention on during the thinking process? To this end, we organize the section around two research questions: (RQ1) Whether multimodal models require visual perception at every step of reasoning? (RQ2) If not, can their internal representations indicate when visual perception and reasoning is required?

# 3.1 Dynamic Perception-Reasoning is Necessary

Definition 3.1 (Visual Dependency Score). Let the visual input be denoted as I, and its perturbed version as $\tilde { I } .$ Given a query $q _ { \ast }$ , the model’s dependence on visual information can be quantified by measuring the output discrepancy between the original and perturbed visual inputs. Specifically, for the i-th generated sequence $\mathcal { X } _ { i } = \{ x _ { i , 1 } , x _ { i , 2 } , . . . , x _ { i , t } \} _ { \mathrm { { \scriptsize { : \scriptsize ~ } } } }$ , the visual dependency score at position $t$ is defined as:

$$
S _ { i , t } = \log \pi _ { \theta } ( x _ { i , t } \mid x _ { i , < t } , I , q ) - \log \pi _ { \theta } ( x _ { i , t } \mid x _ { i , < t } , \tilde { I } , q )
$$

where $\pi _ { \theta } ( \cdot )$ denotes the token-level conditional probability distribution of the model. A larger $S _ { i , t }$ indicates a stronger dependency of the generated token on visual information. Building upon the above metric, we analyze visual dependency on the Math-Vision benchmark using the Qwen2.5-VL-7B [42] at two levels. First, for individual reasoning chains, we compute token-level visual dependency scores, capturing how much each generated token relies on visual information, as illustrated in Figure 2(a). Second, as shown in Figure 2(b), we aggregate these

Figure 2: Analysis of visual dependency in reasoning. (A) Token-level distribution shows visual sensitivity is concentrated in a few tokens. (B) Chain-level distribution reveals large variation in visual reliance across reasoning trajectories.

scores across full reasoning trajectories to obtain chain-level visual dependency, which reveals how different reasoning paths vary in their reliance on visual perception. These results reveal that:

Takeaway 1. The dependency on visual input across the reasoning process is highly uneven: only a small subset of tokens show strong sensitivity to visual features, while the majority operate independently of the image.

$\blacktriangle$ Takeaway 2. Across reasoning chains sampled from the same model, visual dependency varies substantially.
Chains exhibiting stronger visual reliance consistently yield higher accuracy.

# 3.2 Internal Confidence Affects Multimodal Reasoning

Definition 3.2 (Confidence Gain). Let $I$ denote the visual input, $q$ the query, and $\mathcal { T } _ { t }$ denotes the reasoning at step t. The Confidence Gain at step $t$ is defined as the change in the probability of the ground-truth answer $Y _ { g t }$ after adding step $x _ { t }$ . $A$ positive $\mathcal { G } _ { t }$ suggests that step $x _ { t }$ strengthens the confidence, whereas a negative value indicates the opposite.

$$
\mathcal { G } _ { t } = \log \pi _ { \theta } ( Y _ { g t } \mid I , q , \mathcal { T } _ { \leq t } ) - \log \pi _ { \theta } ( Y _ { g t } \mid I , q , \mathcal { T } _ { < t } )
$$

❖ Observation 1: Higher Confidence Tends to Indicate Higher Reasoning Accuracy. We analyze reasoning chains generated by various reasoning models across four benchmarks, where all chains are partitioned into a correct set $\tau ^ { + }$ and an incorrect set $\mathcal { T } ^ { - }$ based on their answer correctness. We then compute the proportion of reasoning steps for each chain that obtain a positive confidence reward. As shown in Figure 3(a), reasoning chains in ${ { \mathcal { T } } ^ { + } }$ exhibit a substantially higher proportion of positive confidence increments compared to those in $\mathcal { T } ^ { - }$ , indicating that the reasoning leading to correct answers tends to exhibit more stable and higher confidence.

❖ Observation 2: Confidence Reflects Reasoning Chains Quality. We investigate whether confidence dynamics reflect reasoning quality by evaluating reasoning chains within the correct set ${ { \mathcal { T } } ^ { + } }$ using the evaluator GPT-4o [43]. Each chain is assessed for logical validity and factual consistency, and categorized into Faithful and Spurious groups. As shown in Figure 3(b), faithful reasoning chains exhibit a higher proportion of positive confidence increments, suggesting that confidence improvement not only correlates with answer accuracy but also reveals the intrinsic quality of the reasoning process.

(B) Faithful reasoning shows consistently stronger confidence improvement than spurious reasoning.

❖ Observation 3: High Confidence Aligns with Stronger Visual Grounding. We further evaluate various reasoning models on the perception benchmark to analyze the relationship between confidence and visual grounding. Each step in the reasoning chain is categorized as hallucinated or non-hallucination based on whether it refers to an object actually present in the image. As shown in Figure 4, hallucinated steps exhibit lower confidence and weaker visual grounding, while non-hallucinatory steps maintain higher and more stable confidence with stronger visual alignment. The results indicate that confidence acts as an intrinsic signal of visual faithfulness, with higher confidence consistently associated with more reliable reasoning.

# 4. Methodology

# 4.1 Problem Formulation

Given a text input sequence $\mathcal { Q } = \left( q _ { 1 } , \ldots , q _ { k } \right)$ and a set of visual embeddings $\mathcal { Z } = \left( z _ { 1 } , \ldots , z _ { I } \right)$ extracted by a visual encoder, the MLLM $\pi _ { \theta }$ encodes the text sequence into embeddings and incorporates visual features to generate the reasoning sequence $\mathcal { X } = ( x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , \ldots , x _ { N } )$ .

$$
\pi _ { \boldsymbol { \theta } } ( { \mathcal { X } } \mid q , z ) = \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ { N } \pi _ { \boldsymbol { \theta } } ( x _ { n } \mid { \mathcal { X } } _ { < n } , q , z )
$$

where $x _ { < n }$ denotes the sequence of tokens preceding position $n$ . Different from approaches that use the last hidden state of the previous reasoning step as latent think tokens [44, 18], we introduce $L$ learnable latent think tokens into the input sequence, whose embeddings after projection are denoted as $\mathcal { T } = \left[ \pmb { \tau } _ { 1 } , \pmb { \tau } _ { 2 } , \dots , \pmb { \tau } _ { L } \right]$ . These tokens are concatenated with the original inputs and fed into the model. During test-time inference, our core idea is to keep model parameters fixed and improve reasoning solely by optimizing the embeddings of the latent think tokens. Motivated by the observations in Section 3, we define a reward function $\mathcal { R }$ to quantify the confidence of the current latent reasoning state. This leads to the following test-time optimization objective:

$$
\mathcal { T } ^ { * } = \arg \operatorname* { m a x } _ { \mathcal { T } } \mathcal { R } ( \mathcal { T } , \mathcal { Q } , \mathcal { Z } ) ,
$$

In practice, the model iteratively update the latent think tokens for $T$ steps, allowing them to progressively evolve toward directions that maximize the reward.

# 4.2 Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning

In light of the observations in Section 3, DMLR comprises two key processes: dynamic visual injection strategy for RQ1, and confidence-guided optimization of latent think tokens for RQ2, as shown in Figure 5 and Algorithm 1.

Latent Think Tokens Initialization. We initialize the latent think tokens before each iteration to facilitate exploration in the latent space. To this end, we adopt a stochastic perturbation strategy that adds controlled randomness while preserving representation stability. Specifically, multiplicative noise sampled from a Gaussian distribution is applied as a local perturbation to the current latent state:

$$
\boldsymbol { { \mathcal { T } } } ^ { \prime ( t ) } = \boldsymbol { { \mathcal { T } } } ^ { ( t ) } + \boldsymbol { \xi } ^ { ( t ) } , \quad \boldsymbol { \xi } ^ { ( t ) } \sim \mathcal { N } ( 0 , \sigma ^ { 2 } I )
$$

Figure 5: Overview of the proposed DMLR framework. The model performs exploration through controlled noise (Eq. 5) and iteratively optimizes the latent think tokens via confidence-guided policy updates (Eq. 8–9). Dynamic Visual Injection (Eq. 10) selects and updates the best visual patches during optimization, and the optimized latent tokens are decoded (Eq. 3) to produce the output.

where $\sigma ^ { 2 }$ is a variance hyperparameter that controls the magnitude of exploration and $\xi ^ { ( t ) }$ is the multiplicative Gaussian noise sampled at iteration $t$ . More analyses and results are shown in Section 5.3.

Reward Formulation. We propose a confidence-guided reward that dynamically optimizes latent think tokens during reasoning. In contrast to prior approaches [45, 30] that use confidence ony for post-hoc evaluation, we treats it as an intrinsic feedback signal that continuously guides latent reasoning optimization. Given the latent think state $\mathscr { T } ^ { ( t ) }$ , the query $q$ , and visual features $z$ , the model $\pi _ { \theta }$ generates token-level probability distributions $\mathcal { P } _ { i } ^ { ( t ) }$ over the vocabulary $w$ . We further quantify the model’s confidence for each latent think token by computing the truncated entropy over its top- $k$ most probable tokens, defined as:

$$
\mathcal { H } _ { k } \big ( \mathcal { P } _ { i } ^ { ( t ) } \big ) = - \sum _ { w \in \mathrm { T o p } _ { k } \big ( \mathcal { P } _ { i } ^ { ( t ) } \big ) } \mathcal { P } _ { i } ^ { ( t ) } ( w ) \log \big ( \mathcal { P } _ { i } ^ { ( t ) } ( w ) \big )
$$

where $\mathrm { T o p } _ { k } ( \cdot )$ denotes the set of the $k$ tokens with the highest probabilities. A lower value of the entropy $\mathcal { H } _ { k } ( \cdot )$ corresponds to higher confidence in the model’s prediction at that position. The reward for the entire latent reasoning sequence is defined as the complement of the mean truncated entropy computed over all $L$ latent think tokens:

$$
\mathcal { R } ( \mathcal { T } ^ { ( t ) } ) = 1 - \frac { 1 } { L } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { L } \mathcal { H } _ { k } ( \mathcal { P } _ { i } ^ { ( t ) } )
$$

Test-Time Latent Optimization. Recent works [15, 46, 38] have explored test-time gradient optimization to enable adaptation in language tasks, whereas we focus on optimization processes for multimodal latent reasoning. Specifically, during the test-time inference, guided by the objective defined in Equation 7, we adopt a REINFORCE-based [47] direct policy gradient method to adaptively optimize the latent think tokens $\left. T ^ { ( t ) } \right.$ . Assuming that each latent think token is independent, the update rule is formulated as:

$$
\mathcal { T } ^ { ( t ) }  \mathcal { T } ^ { ( t ) } + \eta \nabla _ { \mathcal { T } ^ { ( t ) } } \mathcal { I } ( \mathcal { T } ^ { ( t ) } )
$$

where $\eta$ denotes the learning rate. According to the Policy Gradient Theorem and Equation 5, the gradient can be formulated and further expressed as:

$$
\nabla _ { T } \mathcal { J } ( T ) = \mathbb { E } _ { T ^ { \prime } \sim \pi ( \cdot \vert \mathcal { T } ) } \left[ \mathcal { R } ( T ^ { \prime } ) \nabla _ { T } \log \pi ( \mathcal { T } ^ { \prime } \mid \mathcal { T } ) \right] = \mathbb { E } \left[ \mathcal { R } ( T ^ { \prime } ) \frac { \xi } { \sigma ^ { 2 } } \right] .
$$

Visual Injection Strategy. Different from methods that directly inject high-attention regions [41], our strategy updates the most informative visual patches based on the reward at each iteration and injects them as latent visual tokens. As illustrated in Algorithm 1, we first use the initial attention of the latent think token to collect $m$ highly relevant image patches (see Section 5.1), which serve as the initial best patch $\mathcal { V } _ { b e s t }$ . At each iteration, the model resamples $m$ candidate patches $\mathcal { Z } _ { c a n d } = \{ \mathcal { Z } _ { 1 } , \ldots , \mathcal { Z } _ { m } \}$ based on the updated attention and injects them together with the previous best patch into the latent sequence for reward, as formulated in Equation 10. If the reward $r > r _ { b e s t }$ , indicating that the candidate patches provide enhanced visual evidence, the best patch $\nu _ { \mathrm { b e s t } }$ is updated; otherwise, the previous best is retained.

$$
r = \mathcal { R } { \left( \mathcal { Z } , \mathcal { Q } , [ { T } ^ { ( t ) } , \mathcal { V } _ { b e s t } , \mathcal { Z } _ { c a n d } ] \right) }
$$

As the iterations progress, the best visual patch converges to the regions most relevant to the latent think state, guiding the latent reasoning toward more effective optimization.

# 4.3 Theoretical Analysis

To further understand why DMLR achieves high efficiency and robust performance, we provide theoretical explanations through the following two theorems.

Theorem 4.1 (Confidence Reflects Reasoning Quality). Let $h$ denote the latent reasoning state in DMLR, where $C ( h )$ represents the model’s confidence level and $Q ( h )$ denotes the corresponding reasoning quality. If and only if the gradients of $C ( h )$ and $Q ( h )$ are positively aligned, the DMLR update along the confidence ascent direction will consequently improve the reasoning quality:

$$
\nabla C ( h ) \cdot \nabla Q ( h ) > 0
$$

Theorem 4.2. (Visual Injection Enhances Confidence). Let $\tau$ be the latent reasoning states, $\hat { \tau }$ denote the updated states after visual injection, and $z _ { v }$ be the visual features. Visual injection in DMLR increases the mutual information between latent states and visual features, thereby enhancing the expected confidence $J _ { c o n f } ( { \boldsymbol { T } } ) _ { \cdot }$ , satisfying:

$$
I ( \hat { T } ; z _ { v } ) \geq I ( \mathcal T ; z _ { v } ) \Rightarrow J _ { \mathrm { c o n f } } ( \hat { T } ) \geq J _ { \mathrm { c o n f } } ( \mathcal T )
$$

# 5. Experiments

# 5.1 Experiment Setup

Baselines. We evaluate the proposed DMLR using two types of baselines: model-based and method-based. For the model baselines, we consider six representative MLLMs, including two reasoning models, R1- OneVision [48] and VLAA-Thinking [49], as well as four non-reasoning models, Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B [42] and Qwen3-VL-4B/8B [50]. For method baselines, we consider two reasoning paradigms: Text-only Reasoning (CCoT [51]) and Vision-Text Involved Reasoning (ICoT [41], Multimodal-CoT [52]). We further include a Vanilla baseline where non-reasoning models answer directly and reasoning models use their default prompts.

Evaluation Benchmarks. We evaluate our method on three tasks across six benchmarks: (1) Mathematics Reasoning (MathVista $\mathrm { \ m i n i }$ [53], MathVision $\mathrm { \ m i n i }$ [54], MM Math [55] ); (2) Visual Reasoning (Hallusion-Bench [56], MMVP [24]); (3) Multimodal Composition (MMStar [57], ScienceQA [58]). Details are provided in Appendix A.1.

Implementation Details. All frameworks adopt the eager attention mode to enable access to internal attention maps. A total of 4 latent think tokens $\tau$ are used, with $m = 2$ visual candidate patches injected at each iteration. The defaultnumber of optimization iterations is set to 15, with a learning rate of $1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ . To ensure stable exploration in the latent space, the perturbation magnitude $\sigma$ is set to $1 0 \%$ . All experiments are conducted on four NVIDIA H100 GPUs, with further detailed parameter analyses in Appendix A.3.

# 5.2 Main Results

Overall Results. As shown in Table 1, models integrated with DMLR achieve the best performance on over $9 5 \%$ of tasks. On mathematical and visual reasoning benchmarks, Qwen2.5-VL-7B achieves average improvements of $+ 1 . 5 \%$ in mathematics and $+ 0 . 9 \%$ in visual reasoning, while the reasoning counterpart R1-OneVision attains average gains of $+ 4 . 5 \%$ and $+ 3 . 4 5 \%$ on the two domains, respectively. These results indicate that DMLR generalizes robustly across diverse model paradigms and scales. Unlike other baseline methods that often involve trade-offs between reasoning and perception, DMLR consistently improves performance in both domains. For instance, while ICoT yields noticeable gains on mathematical tasks but provides only limited improvements on visual reasoning (e.g., MMVP), DMLR delivers more stable cross domain enhancements, with DMLR-integrated VLAA-Thinking averaging $+ 2 . 4 3 \%$ higher across all benchmarks.

Impact of Visual Injection Strategies. We evaluate various visual injection strategies to assess their effects on reasoning performance. As shown in Table 2, removing visual injection maintains stable reasoning results but leads to a clear drop in perceptual accuracy, underscoring the necessity of visual cues during latent optimization. Injecting all visual patches enhances perception but introduces instability due to redundant visual information. In contrast, DMLR exhibits consistently more stable performance, indicating that its continuously selects more relevant and stable visual information throughout the iterative optimization.

Impact of Iteration Number. As shown in Figure 6, increasing the number of iterations leads to a steady improvement on both reasoning and perception tasks, indicating that iterative optimization effectively enhances latent reasoning. Morever, the reasoning model maintains consistently higher accuracy throughout the process and continues to yield gains even after multiple iterations, demonstrating a stronger ability to benefit from iterative refinement.

Impact of Noise Scale. We further analyze the influence of the perturbation magnitude $\sigma$ on latent optimization. As shown in Figure 7(b), increasing the initial noise scale promotes effective exploration, allowing the model to cover a wider range of latent trajectories and identify higher-confidence reasoning paths. However, when $\sigma$ becomes excessively large, the injected perturbation makes the updates unstable, leading to a subsequent drop in performance. This indicates that latent reasoning benefits from only a modest level of perturbation.

Impact of Visual Patch Number. As shown in Figure 7(a), performance improves when a moderate number of candidate visual patches are injected, whereas injecting an excessive number of patches leads to a clear decline. This trend indicates that a limited number of candidates is sufficient for effective updates, while excessive patches introduce redundant visual information that negatively affect optimization. Furthermore, Figure 8 shows that as the iterations progress, the reward steadily increases and the selected best patch becomes increasingly stable, exhibiting a clear convergence trend. This trend indicates that the dynamic injection strategy does not continually introduce additional visual patches into the latent space, but instead converges toward a small set of highly relevant patches during optimization.

Figure 9: Effect of the number of latent tokens. Increasing the number of latent tokens initially improves performance, but excessive tokens lead to noticeable degradation.

Number of Latent Think Tokens. We further evaluate the impact of the number of latent think tokens on overall performance. As shown in Figure 9, setting the number of latent tokens to a small range (2–4) yields stable improvements on both reasoning and perception tasks. However, as the number of tokens continues to increase, performance on both tasks begins to decline, with the reasoning model exhibiting more pronounced fluctuations. This overall trend indicates that increasing the number of latent tokens beyond a moderate level does not provide additional benefits and instead makes the optimization process less stable.

# 5.4 Quantitative Analysis

Visual Grounding Analysis. We visualize the attention heatmaps of VLAA-Thinking during the reasoning process. As shown in Figure 10(a), the explicit CoT baseline often shifts its attention toward task-irrelevant regions, whereas DMLR maintains a stable focus on task-relevant areas. This demonstrates that latent multimodal reasoning produces more consistent and reliable visual grounding throughout the reasoning process. Figure 10(b) further shows the evolution of attention across iterations. The attention distribution gradually converges toward task-relevant regions in models integrated with DMLR, reflecting a more stable and consistent focus throughout the optimization.

Figure 10: Qualitative analysis of our DMLR framework. (A) Visual comparison of visual grounding behaviors between Explicit CoT and DMLR across diverse queries. DMLR produces more focused and stable visual grounding than explicit CoT. (B) Perception optimization across latent think token iterations, where visual attention becomes progressively sharper and better aligned with relevant regions. (C) Visualization of latent embeddings showing the geometric separation of latent think tokens, text tokens, and image tokens, illustrating the structured organization of the latent reasoning space.

Latent Behavior Analysis. We visualize the final distributions of latent think tokens, text tokens, and image tokens using t-SNE [59] to analyze the effect of the iterative optimization on the latent reasoning. As shown in Figure 10(c), the latent think tokens form a tight cluster that is well separated from both text and visual embeddings, and are located in a stable intermediate region between the two modalities. This distribution suggests that the optimized latent tokens become modality-independent, forming a unified cross-modal semantic representation. The compactness of the cluster further indicates that the optimization process yields more stable and consistent latent reasoning states.

Inference Efficiency Analysis. As shown in Figure 11, different reasoning paradigms exhibit distinct tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency. The explicit methods such as Multimodal CoT rely on long-chain text generation, incurring substantial computational overhead. Although ICoT enhances reasoning to some extent, it injects a large volume of visual information during decoding, which significantly slows inference. In contrast, DMLR performs optimization entirely within the latent space, introducing no additional sequence generation cost. Moreover, its dynamic visual injection strategy selects only the relevant visual patches to the current latent state at each iteration, eliminating redundant visual computation. By preserving accuracy gains while reducing inference overhead, DMLR achieves a more favorable balance between efficiency and performance.

# 6. Conclusion

In this work, we analyze how MLLMs utilize visual information and confidence during reasoning. Based on these observations, we introduce DMLR, a test-time multimodal latent reasoning framework that integrates confidence-guided latent optimization with dynamic visual injection.This method enables models to refine their reasoning, retrieve visual evidence only when need without training. Extensive experiments across various tasks show that DMLR consistently boosts both reasoning and perception tasks, offering a stable and training-free alternative to other methods.

For all datasets, we limit the maximum sample size to 1000 instances.

# A.2 Evaluation Setting

We adopt a unified prompting setup for all models. Unless otherwise stated, we use greedy decoding (do_sample $\mathbf { \lambda } =$ False) for all generation tasks.

# System Prompt.

A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.

# Task Prompt.

Please analyze the image carefully and solve this problem step by step. Show your reasoning process clearly, then put your final answer within \boxed{}.

Question: [Problem Text]

For all benchmarks considered in our experiments, the ground-truth answers are verifiable; we use regular expressions to extract the content within \boxed{} from the model outputs and then match it against the correct answers.

# A.3 Parameters Setup

▶ Latent Think Tokens $\tau$ : We set the number of latent think tokens to 4. During generation, after each latent token the model dynamically injects a visual patch into the latent stream to refresh its internal perception state.

Image Patches m: We dynamically insert visual patches into the latent stream. At initialization, we inject 2 patches; at each subsequent iteration, we select $m = 2$ patches with the highest attention scores and append them after each latent think token, with at most 16 patches inserted per iteration. Additionally, we set the image processor’s max pixel size to 256 for all inputs.

▶ Optimization Parameters: We perform 15 latent optimization steps with a learning rate of $1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ . To ensure stable exploration in the latent space, the perturbation magnitude is set to $\sigma = 0 . 1$ $( 1 0 \% )$ with a decay factor of 0.95, and we fix the random seed to 42 for all experiments.

Environment Setup: All experiments are conducted on NVIDIA H100 GPUs. For a fair comparison, we run all baselines and our method in float32 precision and use the eager attention backend for inference.

# B. Case Study

In this section, we provide qualitative examples to illustrate the behavior of the DMLR-enhanced model across different task settings. As shown in the following example, the model demonstrates more reliable and fine-grained visual perception, supported by stable and semantically coherent internal representations. In reasoning scenarios, the model produces accurate and well-structured logical steps. Importantly, the dynamic latent reasoning mechanism suppresses unnecessary expansions, resulting in concise and taskfocused reasoning chains rather than overly long or speculative explanations. Taken together, these examples highlight that DMLR simultaneously strengthens perceptual quality and reasoning reliability, while ensuring that the generated reasoning remains efficient and free from redundant elaboration.

Figure 12: Question: Is the door of the truck cab open? Options: (a) Yes (b) No Ground Truth: (a)

# Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct $^ +$ DMLR:

The image shows a garbage truck with its door on the side of the cab open. This is evident from the visible interior and the fact that the door is not aligned with the rest of the vehicle’s structure, indicating it has been opened. The answer is $\boxed { a } .$ .

# Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct:

To determine if the door of the truck cab is open, let’s analyze the image step by step:

1. Observe the side of the truck where the door would be located.
2. Look for any visible gap or opening that would indicate the door is not closed.
3. Check the overall appearance of the door; if it is open, there should be a noticeable gap or difference in the alignment compared to when it is closed.

Upon examining the image:

$\blacktriangleright$ The door appears to be aligned with the rest of the truck’s body. There is no visible gap or difference in the alignment that would suggest the door is open.

Based on this analysis, the door of the truck cab does not appear to be open. <think> The door of the truck cab is not open.</think> <answer> No</answer>

Figure 13: Question: A beetle walks along the edges of a cube. Starting from point $P$ it first moves in the direction shown. At the end of each edge it changes the direction in which it turns, turning first right then left, then right etc. Along how many edges will it walk before it returns to point $P 1$ ?

Ground Truth: 6

# Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct $^ +$ DMLR:

The beetle starts at point P and moves along the edges of a cube, changing direction according to the pattern: right, left, right. To determine how many edges it will walk before returning to point P, we need to trace its path.

1. The beetle starts at P.
2. It moves right to an adjacent vertex.
3. It turns left to another adjacent vertex.
4. It turns right again to reach a third adjacent vertex.
5. It continues this pattern until it returns to P.

By examining the cube’s structure, we can see that after 6 edges, the beetle will return to point P because each face of the cube has 4 edges, and the beetle covers all edges of one face before repeating the pattern on the next face.

Thus, the beetle will walk along 6 edges before returning to point P.

# Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct:

To solve this problem, we need to track the beetle’s path as it moves along the edges of the cube, changing its direction according to the specified pattern (right, left, right, etc.).

1. Initial Position and Direction: The beetle starts at point $P$ and moves in the direction indicated by the arrow,
which is along one edge of the cube.
2. First Edge: The beetle moves along the first edge and changes direction to the right.
3. Second Edge: Moving right, the beetle now faces a new direction and continues along the next edge.
4. Third Edge: After moving along the second edge, the beetle changes direction again to the left.
5. Fourth Edge: Moving left, the beetle now faces another new direction and continues along the next edge.
6. Fifth Edge: After moving along the third edge, the beetle changes direction to the right again.
7. Sixth Edge: Moving right, the beetle now faces yet another new direction and continues along the next edge.
8. Seventh Edge: After moving along the fourth edge, the beetle changes direction to the left once more.
9. Eighth Edge: Moving left, the beetle now faces a new direction and continues along the next edge.

At this point, the beetle has completed a full cycle around the cube, returning to point $P$ The beetle will have walked along 8 edges before it returns to point $P$ . The answer is 8.
